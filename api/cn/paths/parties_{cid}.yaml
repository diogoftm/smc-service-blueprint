  summary: Set computation parties
  description: |
    Set all peers of a computation identified by `cid`.

    The order of the `ips` and `saes` shall be correlated and match the
    `index` of each party. Consequently, if for a given CN, the `index` is
    set as, for example, `0`, the index 0 of each list is for this CN. 
    Nonetheless, all values matter since it will enable the CNs to know 
    where to find its peers.

    The `usePSK` when set to `true` shall trigger the CNs to (establish and) 
    set a pre-shared key for key combination.
