  summary: Set computation number of inputs per party
  description: |
    Set the number of inputs for all parties in a computation identified by `cid`.

    In the request body, `nInputs` includes the inputs for this specific CN, this
    ensures that even if the parties were not yet set, the CN can already know its
    number of inputs. `nInputsAllPArties` has the list of inputs for all parties, 
    the order and size of this list shall match the one imputed in `/parties/{cid}`. 
    This ensures that each Cn can make an association between the number of inputs
    and a specific peer CN. 

    Not available after the computation has started or finished execution.
